## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build an age calculator app that calculates the age from the given date of birth.

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date of birth
- Receive validation errors if the date of birth is invalid or if the date is in the future
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to build an age calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I practiced working with date objects, implementing form validation, and displaying the calculated age in a user-friendly format. Additionally, I gained experience in creating responsive layouts, handling edge cases, and providing clear error messages.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to continue enhancing my skills in JavaScript, focusing on improving code organization, modularization, and error handling. I also aim to explore more advanced JavaScript concepts like working with APIs and implementing more complex form validations. Additionally, I will continue to improve my responsive web design skills and accessibility practices.
